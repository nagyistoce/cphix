Why is the CPhix different than many other applications for batch processing of photos?
Well, it ANALYSES each image. This mean it calculates current saturation, sharpness and distribution of brightness. And based on results it applies changes. Most of similar programs applies user-defined changes to all images (the same saturation, sharpening whatever), so you have to group similar images together and tell application what to do. Here, you don't set up almost anything (still there is few switches) and program will "normalize" images for you.

See few examples here: http://code.google.com/p/cphix/wiki/Examples
