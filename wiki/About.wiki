#summary Introduction to cphix.


 =CPhix - Batch processing of photos - analyses and modifies saturation, sharpness and brightness=

*Why is CPhix different?*

It analyses each image. It calculates saturation, sharpness and current distribution of brightness. And based on results it applies changes. Most of similar programs applies user-defined changes to all images, so you have to group similar images together and tell application what to do. Here, you dont say almost anything (still there is few switches) and program will "normalize" images for you.


*Intended use*

This tool is used for very basic processing of images, f.e. when you need to process huge number of photos from vacation and so on and are not willing to manually edit them. Part of processing is downscale and including a text into them.

*Logic of processing:*

Well all is just a mathematics. The cphix attemtps to calculate (average/overall) level of brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness and compare the value with target range and apply modifications. For better understanding here is an example:


{{{
[many images processed here]
==> Image  21/21: IMG_0861.JPG    ( 2048 x 1536)
  Brightness gamma: 0.54, change: 0.36->0.58 (target: 0.58-0.70)
  Contrast gamma  : 0.82, change: 0.36->0.30 (target: 0.30-0.45)
  Saturation gamma: 0.72, change: 0.06->0.12 (target: 0.12-0.22), good samples: 214, OoR:  0
  Saturation boost: 1.00, change: 0.12->0.12 (target: 0.12-0.22), good samples: 214, OoR:  0
  Sharpness boost: 1.12, change: 0.08->0.09 (target: 0.09-0.30), good samples: 214, OoR:  0
  Rescaling to 1154 x 866 (1.00 mpx)
==SUMMARY (per change - count of images):
   Type of modif.       | Decreased | Increased |Not changed|
   Brightness           |         0 |        18 |          3|
   Contrast             |         1 |        14 |          6|
   Saturation           |         0 |        18 |          3|
   Sharpness            |         0 |        12 |          9|

Look at "change" part of lines, there you can see old value and new value and how they fits into target range.
At the end there is and summary of processed images.

*Switches:*

Well, use 'cphix.bin -h' to see switches as avaiable by now....

*Limitations:*

Well, this is not finished yet and there are couple of features that are to be applied yet.


*Participation:*

I would welcome a feedback. For example - photos that gave strange results and so on.
But I would be glad for any even small issues you had with this tool.

*Supported platforms*

It is intended for linux, but in theory it should work also on other unix-like systems and windows as well.
