Just be aware that with many images the changes will not be visible - or rather, no changes will be needed, so dont be disappointed... , this is feature not bug :)

Part of snow-mode is snow-white balancing, usually the need and effect is not significant, but below is an example when image was badly disaligned, probably due to use of a flash.
